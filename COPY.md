### Questions (Rotating)

1. You've been asked to slow down. What does that bring up in you?
2. If you're feeling daring… move your body to this song now.
3. If you're feeling daring… move your body to this song now.
4. You wake up in the middle of the night. What are the problems that keep you awake?
5. The news covers a crisis. You think "if they just did X..." What's the X you know would work?
6. Someone asks why these problems matter so much to you. What memory or moment comes to mind first?
7. You've had the same idea for months without acting on it. What excuse are you telling yourself, and what will you regret if nothing changes by next year?
8. A door is closing slowly. You can still walk through it, but not for long. What's stopping your feet, and what's on the other side?
9. You're in a room with the collaborators you always wanted, and those you never knew you needed. What's possible now that felt impossible to you before?
10. What's love got to do with it?

## Descent Section

### 1. The Convergence Moment

You've heard this countless times before. It's the same old story: we're at a threshold. AI, climate, and collective incoherence are accelerating faster than our solutions. The old incentives aren't working. The standard approaches aren't aligned to what humanity actually needs.

**The question is: now what?**

The answer lies in the alchemy of bringing people together who are ready to commit their next 2 years to solutions. Who have the courage to stand in their truth and who we support to build what emerges.

### 2. The Conditions for Alchemy

*We create five essential conditions that make the extraordinary inevitable.*

**01. Unlikely Combinations** *Cross-sector collisions that spark the new*

What happens when a technologist meets an indigenous wisdom keeper? When a filmmaker collaborates with a consciousness researcher? We bring together people from radically different worlds and create the conditions for these sparks to linger.

**02. Resourced from the Start** *Remove every obstacle to creation*

Most gatherings end with inspiration and business cards. Ours end with funded collaborations already in motion. We provide immediate funding, infrastructure, time, space, and remove the logistical friction.

**03. Fertile Soil** *The ground from which emergence happens*

A process that unveils what's actually there. A mystery school of sorts. Beyond the basics of time spent free from distractions, and inclusive of all of your parts.

**04. Readiness** *Presence and commitment to what emerges*

You're available to commit your next 2 years to steer a course to positive change. You get connected with allies who are as ready as you are.

**05. Domain Expertise** *Wisdom from those who've walked the path*

Each event brings domain experts who are there to provide scaffolding, nuanced understanding and mentorship. These are the people who are actively solving the problems you're stepping into, and know the terrain and how to tread it.

### 3. Who This Is For

You're proud of what you created in the past. You've left a meaningful mark on people. You know deep in your bones that something's amiss. You feel the need to do things differently. You're standing at an empty page, asking "now what?"

The answer lies outside your usual circles.

**Threads:**

- **Implementers** - Builders & Entrepreneurs
- **Artists** - Storytellers, Musicians & Creators
- **Stewards** - Wisdom Keepers
- **Alchemists** - Space Holders, Relational Adepts
