### Contemplative Questions
1. You've been asked to slow down. What does that bring up in you?
2. If you're feeling daring... move your body to this song now.
3. You wake up in the middle of the night. What are the problems that keep you awake?
4. The news covers a crisis. You think "if they just did X..." What's the X you know would work?
5. Someone asks why these problems matter so much to you. What memory or moment comes to mind first?
6. You've had the same idea for months without acting on it. What excuse are you telling yourself, and what will you regret if nothing changes by next year?
7. A door is closing slowly. You can still walk through it, but not for long. What's stopping your feet, and what's on the other side?
8. You're in a room with the collaborators you always wanted, and those you never knew you needed. What's possible now that felt impossible to you before?
9. What if you didn't need to do it alone?

### Rilke Quote
"Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves." — Rainer Maria Rilke

## Descent - The Convergence Moment

We all know what the problems are: AI, climate, mental health crisis, collective incoherence, you name it...

**The question is: now what?**

The answer lies in the alchemy of bringing the right people together at the right time in the right way. This could be the antidote to the epidemic of helplessness.

## Who This Is For

You're proud of what you created in the past. You've made a genuine difference in others' lives. You're ready right now and willing to pivot your life to meaningful projects that come up. You have the courage to stand in your truth. You know deep in your bones that something's amiss. You feel the need to do things differently. You're standing at an empty page, asking "now what?"

The answer lies outside your usual circles.

## The Conditions for Alchemy

*We create five essential conditions that make the extraordinary inevitable.*

### 01. Surprising Collaborations
**Cross-sector collisions that spark the new**

We learn so much through failure and diversity that leads to the most unpredictable outcomes. When we go about things differently with people you'd think have no overlap, we get something none of us could've dreamed up in our silos.

### 02. Resourced from the Start
**Remove every obstacle to creation**

Most gatherings end with inspiration and business cards. Ours end with funded collaborations already in motion. We provide immediate funding, infrastructure, time, space, and remove the logistical friction. We do the due diligence ourselves.

### 03. Fertile Soil
**The ground from which emergence happens**

A process that unveils what's actually there. A school of unteachable lessons, led by master experience designers. Beyond the basics of time spent free from distractions, and inclusive of all of your parts.

### 04. Readiness and Capacity
**Presence and commitment to what emerges**

You're available to commit your next 2 years to steer a course to positive change. You get connected with allies who are as ready as you are.

### 05. Domain Expertise
**Wisdom from those who've walked the path**

Each event brings domain experts who are there to provide scaffolding, nuanced understanding and mentorship. These are the people who are actively solving the problems you're stepping into, and know the terrain and how to tread it.

*If something doesn't feel totally clear, invite that in. We've given you as much as you need to know at this stage.*
